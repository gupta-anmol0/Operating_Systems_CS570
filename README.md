# Operating_Systems_CS570

This repository includes class assignments including implementation of a shell, threads concurrency and signal management.

Assignment 1 includes implementation of a program that manages implementation of multiple threads that write to a single common shared file. As the file is a shared resource, each thread routine uses semaphore to achieve concurrency.

Assignment 2 includes implementation of a shell-like interface for launching new programs, creation of multiple pipes and built-in 'exit' command without implementing other built-in functions such as cd, setenv, ls etc.

Assignment 3 includes design and implementation of an event management program that uses signals to coordinate work among sibling threads. 

For further details, one can access the problem statement in pdf format in each corresponding directories.
